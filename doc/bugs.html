<h1>Known USSR Bugs</h1>

This section of the manual lists known bugs in the simulation and how
to work around them until they are fixed.  To report bugs, please
contact the maintainer <a href="mailto:ups@mmmi.sdu.dk">Ulrik P
Schultz</a>.

<h2>General bugs</h2>

The following bugs are known to exist in the simulator.
<ul>
<li>Mac OS X: the simulator is incompatible with JDK 1.6 (we do not have 64-bit versions of our native libraries) and 
for versions of eclipse above 3.2 the SWT-AWT bridge must be installed (download from Apple Developer Connection)
</li>
</ul>

<h2>ATRON simulation bugs</h2>

The following bugs are known to exist in the ATRON simulation.
<ul>
<li>Rubber rings and grids: putting rubber rings on modules cause tightly connected structures 
to vibrate and become unstable.  Solution: avoid modules with rubber rings connecting directly to 
each other, for example by only having rubber-ring modules present in one orientation in a grid.</li>
</ul>

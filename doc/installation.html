<h1>USSR Installation</h1>

We recommend using the eclipse IDE to develop software using USSR, but
any editor and Java compiler should do the job.  Linux users please
note that Sun's own Java implementation is apparently needed for
eclipse and USSR to run correctly.

<h2>Installation with eclipse</h2>

To work with USSR using eclipse, follow these steps.

<ol>

<li>Unzip the archive containing USSR.</li>

<li>If you have not already done so, install <a href="eclipse.org">eclipse</a>.
  (First-time eclipse users may want to follow the eclipse tutorial before proceeding with
  USSR.)</li>

<li>Create a project: From the eclipse menu, choose <strong>File: New: Java
  Project</strong>, type in the project name (e.g., <tt>ussr</tt>), pick <strong>Create
  project from existing source</strong>, use the browse button to locate the root of the
  unzipped USSR distribution, and click <strong>Finish</strong>.  If eclipse asks you
  whether to use subversion control, answer no.</li>

<li>After building you should be able to run the examples, as described in
the <a href="usage.html">usage</a> section.</li>

</ol>

If eclipse was for some reason unable to read the project settings such as the classpath,
compilation will fail.  See the installation part of the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for a
specification of how to set up the class path.

<h2>Installation without eclipse</h2>

To work with USSR without eclipse, simply start by unzipping the archive.  The compiled
Java files are in the <tt>bin</tt> subdirectory, ready to run.  Nevertheless, USSR has a
significant number of runtime and compiletime dependencies within the project, as
follows.  (If the settings in eclipse for some reason cannot be automatically important,
the following information also has to be entered manually in the project properties.)

<ul>

<li>When running USSR, the classpath must include the following:
<pre>
zoo/jME/lib/native-mac.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_util.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_util_applet.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_test.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_fmod3.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_applet.jar
zoo/jME/lib/jorbis-0.0.12.jar
zoo/jME/lib/jogg-0.0.5.jar
zoo/jME/lib/jinput.jar
</pre>
(In to addition the <tt>bin</tt> directory which must of course also be included on the
command line.)
</li>

<li>Moreover, when running USSR, the native library path must include the following directories:
<pre>
zoo/jME/lib
zoo/jmephysics/impl/ode/lib
</pre>
</li>

<li>When compiling USSR, the source path must include the following directories:
<pre>
zoo/jME/src
zoo/jmephysics/impl/ode/src
</pre>
(In addition to the <tt>src</tt> directory which must of course also be included on the
command line.)
Note that these directories are needed when compiling, but assuming they are also compiled into
the <tt>bin</tt> directory, they are not needed on the classpath.
</li>

</ul>

Assuming the variable <tt>USSRHOME</tt> points to the root directory of the USSR
distribution, the command lines needed to run the simulations and compile simulations or
projects that use the USSR framework are thus the following on a unix machine:

<pre>
export USSRCLASSPATH=${USSRHOME}/bin:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/native-mac.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_util.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_util_applet.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_test.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_fmod3.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_applet.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/jorbis-0.0.12.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/jogg-0.0.5.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/jinput.jar
export USSRNATIVEPATH=${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jmephysics/impl/ode/lib
export USSRSOURCEPATH=${USSRHOME}/src:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/src:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jmephysics/impl/ode/src
java -classpath ${USSRCLASSPATH} -Djava.library.path=${USSRNATIVEPATH} [Java class name]
javac -classpath ${USSRCLASSPATH} -sourcepath ${USSRSOURCEPATH} [Java source files]
</pre>

(Windows users should modify the path specifications appropriately.)

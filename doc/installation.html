<h1>USSR Installation</h1>

We recommend using the eclipse IDE to develop software using USSR, but
any editor and Java compiler should do the job.  

<h2>Platform-specific configuration</h2>

Although USSR is multi-platform it relies on libraries that have platform-specific dependencies that may require
additional configuration.
<ul>
<li>Linux: the official Oracle JDK is needed</li>
<li>Mac: simulations must run using the 32-bit memory model, see <a href="installation-mac.html">mac installation</a> for details on how to do this</li>
<li>Windows: no additional configuration needed</li>
</ul>
If the simulator crashes, see the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for instructions.

<h2>Installation with eclipse</h2>

To work with USSR using eclipse, follow the steps described on the <a href="http://modular.mmmi.sdu.dk/wiki/USSR">USSR homepage</a>.
You should be able to run the examples, as described in
the <a href="usage.html">usage</a> section.</li>

<p>If eclipse was for some reason unable to read the project settings such as the classpath,
compilation will fail.  See the installation part of the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for a
specification of how to set up the class path.

<h2>Installation without eclipse</h2>

To work with USSR without eclipse, simply check out the disitrubtion from github.  The compiled
Java files are in the <tt>bin</tt> subdirectory, ready to run.  Nevertheless, USSR has a
significant number of runtime and compiletime dependencies within the project, as
follows.  (If the settings in eclipse for some reason cannot be automatically important,
the following information also has to be entered manually in the project properties.)

<ul>

<li>When running USSR, the classpath must include the following:
<pre>
zoo/jME/lib/native-mac.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_util.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_util_applet.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_test.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_fmod3.jar
zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_applet.jar
zoo/jME/lib/jorbis-0.0.12.jar
zoo/jME/lib/jogg-0.0.5.jar
zoo/jME/lib/jinput.jar
</pre>
(In to addition the <tt>bin</tt> directory which must of course also be included on the
command line.)
</li>

<li>Moreover, when running USSR, the native library path must include the following directories:
<pre>
zoo/jME/lib
zoo/jmephysics/impl/ode/lib
</pre>
</li>

<li>When compiling USSR, the source path must include the following directories:
<pre>
zoo/jME/src
zoo/jmephysics/impl/ode/src
</pre>
(In addition to the <tt>src</tt> directory which must of course also be included on the
command line.)
Note that these directories are needed when compiling, but assuming they are also compiled into
the <tt>bin</tt> directory, they are not needed on the classpath.
</li>

</ul>

Assuming the variable <tt>USSRHOME</tt> points to the root directory of the USSR
distribution, the command lines needed to run the simulations and compile simulations or
projects that use the USSR framework are thus the following on a unix machine:

<pre>
export USSRCLASSPATH=${USSRHOME}/bin:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/native-mac.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_util.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_util_applet.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_test.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_fmod3.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/lwjgl_applet.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/jorbis-0.0.12.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/jogg-0.0.5.jar:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib/jinput.jar
export USSRNATIVEPATH=${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/lib:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jmephysics/impl/ode/lib
export USSRSOURCEPATH=${USSRHOME}/src:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jME/src:${USSRHOME}/zoo/jmephysics/impl/ode/src
java -classpath ${USSRCLASSPATH} -Djava.library.path=${USSRNATIVEPATH} [Java class name]
javac -classpath ${USSRCLASSPATH} -sourcepath ${USSRSOURCEPATH} [Java source files]
</pre>

(Windows users should modify the path specifications appropriately.)

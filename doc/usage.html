<h1>USSR Usage</h1>

This section of the manual describes how to <i>use</i> the simulator,
that is, how to run existing simulations and add new simulations of
your own.

<h2>Running a simulation.</h2>

To run a simulation main class such as <a href="api/ussr/samples/atron/ATRONCarSimulation.html">ussr.samples.atron.ATRONCarSimulation</a>, right-click on the class and choose <tt>Run As...Java Application</tt>.  The basic key controls are as follows:

<ul>
<li>To pause/unpause the simulation use <strong>P</strong>, to proceed step-by-step use <strong>SPACE</strong></li>
<li>To move around in the simulation, hold down the right mouse button while using
  <strong>A</strong>/<strong>S</strong>/<strong>D</strong>/<strong>W</strong> as arrow keys.  Use the mouse wheel to move up/down.</li>
<li>To interactively apply a force to an object, click on it and drag the mouse.</li>
<li>To stop the simulation, use the eclipse "stop" button on the console.</li>
</ul>

Numerous other key combinations also control various aspects of the simulation:

<ul>
<li>Tipping the default plane on which simulation takes place: select tipping in X/Y/Z direction with <strong>1</strong>/<strong>2</strong>/<strong>3</strong>, use <strong>4</strong>/<strong>5</strong> to tip one and the other way.</li>
<li>Toggle mouse wheel scroll: <strong>COMMA</strong> (useful if using the scroll wheel when clicking on a simulated object).</li>
<li>Camera positioning: print camera location with <strong>C</strong>.</li>
<li>Frame grabbing: take screenshot with <strong>F1</strong> (defaults
to <tt>SimpleGameScreenShot.png</tt> in the <tt>ussr</tt> directory,
overwrites the same file), toggle frame grabbing with <strong>G</strong> (frames
grabbed from the current simulation will be put in
the <tt>ussr/frames</tt> directory (frames from previous simulations
will be found under <tt>ussr/frames<i>TIME</i></tt>
where <tt><i>TIME</i></tt> is the time expressed in milliseconds when
the simulation was grabbed), grab frame with <strong>F</strong> (the same of taking a
screenshot, except it will appear under the /ussr/frames directory as
if continuously grabbing them, and you can take more than one during
the same simulation without making them overwrite each other).
<li>Display: toggle show physics with <strong>V</strong>, toggle wireframe with <strong>T</strong>, toggle lights with <strong>L</strong>, toggle bounds with <strong>B</strong>, toggle axes normal to surfaces with <strong>N</strong>, select parallel projection with <strong>F2</strong>, set depth with <strong>F3</strong>.
</li>
<li>Print a mem report on the console <strong>and</strong> reset the simulation: <strong>R</strong></li>
</ul>


<h2>Adding a new simulation.</h2>

Use an existing template as an example; a simulation must specify what robot to
use (including the controller), module positions, and can use <a href="api/ussr/samples/atron/GenericATRONSimulation.html#changeWorldHook(ussr.robotbuildingblocks.WorldDescription)">changeWorldHook</a>
like in <a href="api/ussr/samples/atron/ATRONCarSimulation.html">ATRONCarSimulation</a> to e.g. add obstacles.

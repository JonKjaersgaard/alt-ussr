<h1>USSR Usage</h1>

This section of the manual describes how to <i>use</i> the simulator,
that is, how to run existing simulations and add new simulations of
your own.

<h2>Running a simulation.</h2>

To run a simulation main class such as <tt>ussr.samples.atron.ATRONCarSimulation</tt>

<ul>
<li>To pause/unpause the simulation, use 'P'</li>
<li>To move around in the simulation, hold down the right mouse button while using
  A/S/D/W as arrow keys.  Use the mouse wheel to move up/down.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding a new simulation.</h2>

Use an existing template as an example; a simulation must specify what robot to
use (including the controller), module positions, and can use <tt>changeWorldHook</tt>
like in <tt>ATRONCarSimulation</tt> to e.g. add obstacles.

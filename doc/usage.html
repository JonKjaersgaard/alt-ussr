<h1>USSR Usage</h1>

This section of the manual describes how to <i>use</i> the simulator,
that is, how to run existing simulations and add new simulations of
your own.

<h2>Running a simulation.</h2>

To run a simulation main class such as <a href="api/ussr/samples/atron/ATRONCarSimulation.html">ussr.samples.atron.ATRONCarSimulation</a>, right-click on the class and choose <tt>Run As...Java Application</tt>.  The basic key controls are as follows:

<ul>
<li>To pause/unpause the simulation use <strong>P</strong>, to proceed step-by-step use <strong>SPACE</strong></li>
<li>To move around in the simulation, hold down the right mouse button while using
  <strong>A</strong>/<strong>S</strong>/<strong>D</strong>/<strong>W</strong> as arrow keys.  Use the mouse wheel to move up/down.</li>
<li>To interactively apply a force to an object, click on it and drag the mouse.</li>
<li>To stop the simulation, use the eclipse "stop" button on the console.</li>
</ul>

Numerous other key combinations also control various aspects of the simulation:

<ul>
<li>Tipping the default plane on which simulation takes place: select tipping in X/Y/Z direction with <strong>1</strong>/<strong>2</strong>/<strong>3</strong>, use <strong>4</strong>/<strong>5</strong> to tip one and the other way.</li>
<li>Toggle mouse wheel scroll: <strong>COMMA</strong> (useful if using the scroll wheel when clicking on a simulated object).</li>
<li>Camera positioning: print camera location with <strong>C</strong>.</li>
<li>Frame grabbing: take screenshot with <strong>F1</strong> (defaults
to <tt>SimpleGameScreenShot.png</tt> in the <tt>ussr</tt> directory,
overwrites the same file), toggle frame grabbing with <strong>G</strong> (frames
grabbed from the current simulation will be put in
the <tt>ussr/frames</tt> directory (frames from previous simulations
will be found under <tt>ussr/frames<i>TIME</i></tt>
where <tt><i>TIME</i></tt> is the time expressed in milliseconds when
the simulation was grabbed), grab frame with <strong>F</strong> (the same of taking a
screenshot, except it will appear under the /ussr/frames directory as
if continuously grabbing them, and you can take more than one during
the same simulation without making them overwrite each other).
<li>Display: toggle show physics with <strong>V</strong>, toggle wireframe with <strong>T</strong>, toggle lights with <strong>L</strong>, toggle bounds with <strong>B</strong>, toggle axes normal to surfaces with <strong>N</strong>, select parallel projection with <strong>F2</strong>, set depth with <strong>F3</strong>.
</li>
<li>Print a mem report on the console <strong>and</strong> reset the simulation: <strong>R</strong></li>
</ul>


<h2>Adding a new simulation.</h2>

USSR provides a number of abstract classses to use as templates for
creating simulations.  The sample simulations are all subclasses of
<a href="api/ussr/samples/GenericSimulation.html">ussr.samples.GenericSimulation</a>
which again is subclassed
for <a href="api/ussr/samples/atron/GenericATRONSimulation.html">ATRON</a>.
Basically a simulation just has to create an instance
of <a href="api/ussr/physics/PhysicsSimulation.html">ussr.physics.PhysicsSimulation</a>
which is done by calling
<a href="api/ussr/physics/PhysicsFactory.html#createSimulator()">ussr.physics.PhysicsFactory.createSimulator()</a>
and providing an instance of
<a href="api/ussr/robotbuildingblocks/WorldDescription.html">ussr.robotbuildingblocks.WorldDescription</a>
which describes both the robot to use, the initial configuration of
the robot, and the world in which the robot will be simulated.  Tuning
of various low-level physics parameters is done using 
<a href="api/ussr/physics/PhysicsParameters.html">ussr.physics.PhysicsParameters</a>.

<p>The controller for a robot is specified on a per-module-type
  basis.  Thus, for ATRON there typically will be a single controller,
  whereas each type of Odin module will have its own controller.  Two
  ATRON modules with different controllers are considered to be
  different kinds of modules by the simulator and hence have to be
  added separately.  Controllers have to implement the interface 
<a href="api/ussr/model/Controller.html">ussr.model.Controller</a>,
which has a default implementation provided by the abstract class 
<a href="api/ussr/model/ControllerImpl.html">ussr.model.ControllerImpl</a>.
When using <tt>ControllerImpl</tt> the programmer only has to
implement the <tt>activate</tt> method which defines the behavior of
the controller.  Specific hints on implementing controllers can be
found below.

<p>Specific hints on creating a simulation for the ATRON and Odin
  robots can be found below.  In general, it is a good idea to use one of the existing
  simulations for
<a href="api/ussr/samples/atron/package-summary.html">ATRON</a>, 
<a href="api/ussr/samples/odin/package-summary.html">Odin</a>, or
<a href="api/ussr/samples/mtran/package-summary.html">M-TRAN</a> as a
basis for your simulation.  Independently of the robot type, the
overall setup of the simulation is controlled through
the <a href="api/ussr/robotbuildingblocks/WorldDescription.html">world
description</a>.  There is a helper class for adding obstacles to the
simulation: <a href="api/ussr/samples/ObstacleGenerator.html">ussr.samples.ObstacleGenerator</a>.


<h3>Adding an ATRON simulation</h3>

<p>For the ATRON, write a new simulation by making a subclass
of <a href="api/ussr/samples/atron/GenericATRONSimulation.html">ussr.samples.GenericATRONSimulation</a>.
As a simple example, take a look
  at <a href="api/ussr/samples/atron/ATRONCarSimulation.html">ussr.samples.atron.ATRONCarSimulation</a>.
  In your simulation class, use the method
<a href="api/ussr/samples/atron/GenericATRONSimulation.html#changeWorldHook(ussr.robotbuildingblocks.WorldDescription)">changeWorldHook</a>
to add modules to the simulation (i.e. the world descripton) and
optionally add obstacles.  There is a predefined helper
class for generating typical module and obstacle configurations, namely
<a href="api/ussr/samples/atron/ATRONBuilder.html">ussr.samples.atron.ATRONBuilder</a>
which contains methods for building a variety of different robots.  Either
use the robot building routines directly or use them as a basis for building your own
robot.

<p>Controllers for an ATRON module should subclass the specific controller class
<a href="api/ussr/samples/atron/ATRONController.html">ussr.samples.atron.ATRONController</a>
which provides an implementation of the ATRON API.  See below for
instructions on programming an ATRON controller.

<h3>Adding an Odin simulation</h3>

<p>For the Odin, simply write a new simulation by making a subclass of 
<a href="api/ussr/samples/GenericSimulation.html">ussr.samples.GenericSimulation</a>
that sets up the world description.  Apart from obstacles, the
specific Odin modules that are needed have to be added along with
their controller implementations.

<p>Controllers for an Odin module should subclass the specific controller class
<a href="api/ussr/samples/odin/OdinController.html">ussr.samples.odin.OdinController</a>
which provides a few basic facilities for controlling Odin modules (as
there is not yet a real API for the physical modules, the API is preliminary).

<h2>Programming a controller.</h2>

Controllers typically subclass a specific controller class that
implments the
interface <a href="api/ussr/model/Controller.html">ussr.model.Controller</a>.
The controller subclass may then provide methods specific to the
module type being controlled.  Independently of the robot type, USSR
provides an API for controlling all aspects of the module, provided by
the
package <a href="api/ussr/model/package-summary.html">ussr.model</a>
which for example provides the
class <a href="api/ussr/model/Module.html">Module</a> that serves as an
abstract representation of the hardware the controller is running on.

<p>A controller typically performs various setup operations and then
  enters an infinite loop that uses the API to perform operations on
  the module.  A controller should call the <tt>ControllerImpl</tt>
  method <a href="api/ussr/model/ControllerImpl.html#ussrYield()">ussrYield()</a>
  regularly to ensure fairness between different controllers, prevent
  starvation of the physics simulation, and enable controllers to be
  paused if the simulated world is paused.

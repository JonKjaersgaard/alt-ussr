<h1>USSR Manual</h1>

Welcome to the Unified Simulator for Self-reconfigurable Robots
(USSR).  This user manual provides general information on installing
and using USSR.  

<h2>Sections of the manual</h2>

<ol>
<li><a href="installation.html">Installation</a>: Installation instructions for installing USSR from a ZIP archive.  Information on how to install USSR directly from the MMMI SVN repository is available in the
file <tt>INSTALL-MMMI.txt</tt></li>
<li><a href="usage.html">Usage</a>: Usage instructions for creating and running simulations in USSR</li>
<li><a href="howto.html">Howto</a>: How to instructions for using USSR as a framework to create new simulated robots</li>
<li><a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>: FAQ covering common issues in the other sections of the manual</li>
<li><a href="bugs.html">Bugs</a>: Known bugs in the simlator (with workarounds where possible)</li>
<li><a href="api/index.html">API</a>: JavaDoc API documentation for USSR</li>
</ol>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

Once you have completed the installation, read the <a href="usage.html">usage</a> section
to learn how to run a simulation.  We recommend starting with the ATRON simulations since
they are more mature and the API is better documented.  The next step is creating
e.g. ATRON simulations of you own, also described in the <a href="usage.html">usage</a>
section.  For creating your own robot, follow the instructions in
the <a href="howto.html">howto</a> section of the manual.

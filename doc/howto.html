<h1>USSR Howto</h1>

This section of the manual is a basic introduction to programming with
the USSR simulator framework.  Consult the <a href="api/index.html">Javadoc</a> documentation
for details of the API.

<h2>Adding a new robot step 1: describing the appearance</h2>

To add a new robot type, create an appropriate package to contain the robot
description.  As an example of a minimal robot,
consider <a href="api/ussr/samples/stickybot/package-summary.html">ussr.samples.stickybot</a>.  The
robot description is based on components from the
package <a href="api/ussr/description/robot/package-summary.html">ussr.description.robot</a> with the
appearance described using elements from the
package <a href="api/ussr/description/geometry/package-summary.html">ussr.description.geometry</a>.
Concretely, the physics-engine-independent configuration of a robot is done
using the classes in <tt>ussr.description</tt>: the building blocks are
interpreted by a module factory to create physically simulated modules.  If the
user of the robot does not need to be able to do any actuation or connector
alignment, the robot can be created directly from the description, using the 
<a href="api/ussr/physics/PhysicsFactory.html#addDefaultFactory(java.lang.String)">default
  factory</a> (which as an argument takes the type name of the robot).  This
should be sufficient for creating an interactive representation of the robot
  that can actuate its connectors.  For more advanced features, a factory
must be defined, see below.

<h2>Adding a new robot step 2: defining the details</h2>

Details about a robot must be defined using a JME factory that can add to or
modify the representation of the robot.  The default JME factories are provided
in the
package <a href="api/ussr/physics/jme/robots/package-summary.html">ussr.physics.jme.robots</a>, a
fairly small example with an externally provided factory is
the <a href="api/ussr/samples/white/package-summary.html">White</a> robot.
The module factory
uses components defined in the
package <a href="api/ussr/physics/jme/package-summary.html">ussr.physics.jme</a> and its subpackages to build a module.

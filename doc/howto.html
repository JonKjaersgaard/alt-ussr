<h1>USSR Howto</h1>

This section of the manual is a basic introduction to programming with
the USSR simulator framework.  Note that Javadoc documentation is
available in the <tt>doc</tt> subdirectory.

<h2>Adding a new robot</h2>

To add a new robot type, create an appropriate package to contain the robot 
description (example: see <tt>ussr.samples.atron.ATRON</tt>).  The robot description can
use elements from the package <tt>ussr.robotbuildingclocks</tt>.  Concretely,
the physics-engine-independent configuration of a robot is done using the classes
in <tt>ussr.robotbuildingblocks</tt>: the building blocks are interpreted by a module factory
to create physically simulated modules.  If the user of the robot does not need to
be able to do any configuration, the description geometry can simple be e.g. a sphere
or some dummy geometry.  The type name in the robot description is used to identify
what module factory to use to instantiate the robot for the specific physics engine. 

<p>The physics engine representation of a module (the central element) is implemented 
as a module factory in the package ussr.physics.jme.robots.  The module factory
uses components defined in the package <tt>ussr.physics.jme</tt> to build a module.

In order to start Quick prototyping or so called interactive builder do the following

1) Locate simulation file for one of the modular robots, currently are supported:
   a) InteractiveAtronBuilderTest1.java, which can be found in package  ussr.samples.atron.simulations
   b) InteractiveMtranBuilderTest1.java, which can be found in package ussr.samples.mtran
   c) InteractiveOdinBuilderTest1, which can be found in package ussr.samples.odin.simulations

2) Start  simulation for one of the above files.
3) Press "Q" button on keyboard and wait a bit. On slow machines the Quick prototyping window
is quite slow to respond. 

4) In appeared Quick prototyping window choose one of the buttons(pickers).
   For example for ATRON:
   "Con"- is the picker where you can just click on connector of a module and next module will be added to selected connector
   "ComboBox with numbers"- is the picker where after  selecting the connector number where new module should be added, after that you 
      should click on one of the modules in simulation environment. As a reuslt new module will be added to
      the chosen connector.
   "All"- is the picker where you just click on module and all possible modules are added to the selected module
   "Loop"- is the picker where you just click on module and later press on buttons "Next" or "Back". As a result,
   new module will be moved from one connector to another.  
   
Additional functionality is ability to save the data about the modules in simulation
in XML format. Just choose File-->Save, this will open File chooser, also with quite a delay.

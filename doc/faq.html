<h1>USSR FAQ</h1>

This section of the manual contains various frequently asked questions
regarding use of the simulator.

<h2>Installation FAQs</h2>

<h3>Q1: Why does eclipse display an error that external libraries (jar
  files) cannot be found, after having checked out USSR from the MMMI
  SVN repository?</h3>

<strong>A1:</strong> There appears to be some cross-platform issue with
the path setup.  Remove all the jar files, wait for the system to
build (with lots of errors), then add the jar files again.

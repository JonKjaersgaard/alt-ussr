<h1>USSR FAQ</h1>

This section of the manual contains various frequently asked questions
regarding use of the simulator.  For answers to other questions, please contact the 
maintainer <a href="mailto:ups@mmmi.sdu.dk">Ulrik P Schultz</a>.

<h2>Installation FAQs</h2>

<h3>Qi1: Why does eclipse display an error that external libraries (jar
  files) cannot be found, after having initially installed/checked out USSR?</h3>

<strong>Ai1:</strong> There appears to be some cross-platform issue with
the path setup.  Remove all the jar files, wait for the system to
build (with lots of errors), then add the jar files again.  See Q2 for
a description of what jar files needs to be added and Q3 for a brief
description of how to do this in eclipse.

<h3>Qi2: What jar files and native libraries and source paths and so on
  are required for USSR to run?</h3>

<strong>Ai2:</strong> See
the <a href="installation.html">installation</a> section of the
manual, look under <i>Installation without eclipse</i>.  Basically,
you need to add all the jar files from <tt>zoo/jME/lib</tt> as well as the
native library paths and the source paths listed in the installation section.

<h3>Qi3: How do I change the Java paths for Qi2 in eclipse?</h3>

<strong>Ai3:</strong> Right-click on the project in the package
explorer view, choose <strong>Properties</strong>, then <strong>Java build
path</strong>.  In this view you need to set up
the <strong>Source</strong> and <strong>Libraries</strong> as
specified in Q2.

<h2>Running USSR FAQ</h2>

<h3>Qr1: Why can USSR not create a window when starting up?</h3>

<strong>Ar1:</strong> This error manifests itself with a stack trace including the following error:
<pre>
java.lang.Error: Cannot create window: Could not find a valid pixel format
</pre>
The issue seems to be some incompatibility between the low-level 3D
graphics library USSR uses (through JME) and the driver for the
graphics card.  The general recommendation is to try a different
version of the graphics card driver (preferably a newer one if
available) to solve the problem.

<h3>Qr2: Why does my simulation crash with ODE errors?</h3>

<strong>Ar2:</strong> This error seems to manifest itself when the
physics engine is somehow being "stressed", for example with a large
number of collisions (e.g., vigorous movements with many collisions) or objects moving
very quickly (robot falling over the edge).  
Reducing the size of the physics step or the resolution factor
(see <a href="api/ussr/physics/PhysicsParameters.html">ussr.physics.PhysicsParameters</a>)
usually helps.  Alternatively, to reduce the number of
collisions and perhaps obtain a working simulation, one can try changing the movement patterns of the robot.

<h2>Simulation FAQ</h2>

<h3>Qs1: How do I make my simulation run faster?</h3>

<strong>As1:</strong> Modifying the parameters
in <a href="api/ussr/physics/PhysicsParameters.html">ussr.physics.PhysicsParamters</a>
can have a significant influence on performance: increase step size,
turn off realistic collisions, turn of maintain joint positions,
reduce the resolution factor for spherical geometries.  Moreover,
switching to act-based controllers (see <a href="api/ussr/model/ActBasedController.html">ussr.model.ActBasedController</a>) improves performance when there are many modules in the simulation.

<h3>Qs2: What are the spatial orientations in the simulator and in the ATRON rotations used 
for assembling robots?</h3>

<strong>As2:</strong> The ATRON orientations concern the rotation of
the central axis (around which the main joint rotates).  In the
initial view, x is left-to-right which is called east-west in the
ATRON rotations, y is down-to-up, whereas z is the perspective which
is called north-south.

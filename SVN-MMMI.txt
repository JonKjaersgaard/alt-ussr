Guidelines for working with the MMMI USSR SVN repository.

Administration:
* Pre-MS students are by default given read-only access.  USSR should support
  most standard projects at this level without requiring modifications to
  the classes contained in USSR.  Having read-only access to the repository
  facilitates providing updates to students.
* MS-students can be given read-write access but should normally store their
  work either in a subdirectory of the "home" directory or in a separate
  project. 

Options for working with USSR:
(1) Store your files in a separate project that depends on USSR.
(2) Store your files in a subdirectory of "home", follow the checkin
    guidelines below.
    
Checking in changes to USSR:
* Whenever you need to make use of an external jar file, store it in the "lib"
  directory and consider checking it in straight away.  To commit the change to
  the classpath required to access the jar file, check in the root of the project
  but be selective about what files are selected for checkin (should only be the
  jar file and the .classpath file).
* When checking in changes be selective about what directory you select, you can
  for example select just the "src" directory or the appropriate "home" directory.
  Then review the list of files (or click all files for your home directory) to
  make sure that the correct selection of files is being checked in.
  
If something goes wrong: ask Franco, he knows how to repair damages to the repository :-)

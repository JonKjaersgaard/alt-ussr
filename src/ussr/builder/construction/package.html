This package contains the classes and interfaces, the main responsibility of which is construction
of modular robots morphology. The approach is common for all supported modular robots, but 
implementation algorithms differ. That is why Strategy pattern is used. Moreover to indicate that in order
to support new modular robot, new implementation is needed. The code was tested on ATRON, MTRAN and Odin 
modular robots and as a result they are supported.
HOWTO. Support new modular robot?
 1)Create new class and inherit it from ModularRobotConstructionStrategy.java
 2)Implement inherited abstract methods, like moveModuleAccoring(), updateModuleMap()(these two at least) 
 and so on. Use existing support of modular robots like inspiration. For example class called 
 ATRONConstructionStrategy.java
 3)Scan classes: CommonOperationsStrategy.java and ConstructionToolSpecification.java for bugs
   or missing implementation.
 4)set your new constructionTool from GUI or somewhere else like this:
    JMESimulation.setPicker(new ConstructionToolSpecification(JMESimulation, "NewModularRobotName","toolName"));

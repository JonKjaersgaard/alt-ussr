In order to start Quick prototyping or so called interactive builder do the following

1) Locate simulation file for one of the modular robots, currently are supported:
   a) InteractiveAtronBuilderTest1.java, which can be found in package  ussr.samples.atron.simulations
   b) InteractiveMtranBuilderTest1.java, which can be found in package ussr.samples.mtran
   c) InteractiveOdinBuilderTest1, which can be found in package ussr.samples.odin.simulations

2) Start  simulation for one of the above files.
3) Press "Q" button on keyboard and wait a bit. On slow machines the Quick prototyping window
is quite slow to respond. For example on machine with 1.7 GHz, 1GB RAM it is starting after 
10-15 seconds (Future work to improve:)). 

4) In appeared Quick prototyping window choose one of the buttons(pickers).
   For example for ATRON:
   A1- is the picker where you can just click on connector of a module and next module will be added to selected connector
   A2- is the picker where after clicking on button A2 you should choose the connector number where new module should be added, after that click on one
       of the modules in simulation environment
   A3- is the picker where you just click on module and all possible modules are added to the selected module
   A4- is the picker where you just click on module and later press on  arrow facing to the right (the button
       to the right from the A4). Looks something like that "-->". This should move the new module added to 
       selected module in the way that all connections are checked sequentially.
  
   For example for MTRAN(The pickers are the same as for ATRON above, the only difference
   that they are not completely implemented):
   M1 - works, but not completely 
   M2 - works, but not completely 
   M3 - works, but not completely 
   M4 - doesn't work
   
   For example for Odin:(The pickers are the same as for ATRON above, the only difference
   that they are not completely implemented)
   O1 - doesn't work
   O2 - works
   O3 - works
   O4 - works
   
Additional functionality is ability to save the data about the modules in simulation
in XML format. Just choose File-->Save, this will open File chooser, also with quite a delay.

Supports with interactive assignment of controllers to modules selected in 
the simulation environment. Look in class called "AssignControllerTool.java".
HOWTO. Add my own controller class?
1) Create new class and inherit it from "ControllerStrategy.java".
2) Implement the method called "activate()", which is the main method of your controller.
   Look other classes like "ATRONWheelController.java" and so on for inspiration.
3) Start simulation and from GUI comboBox select the name of your controller class.
   (All this can be found in toolBar nr8 from the top in GUI).
   After that select the module in simulation environment to which you would like to apply
   this controller. The controller should start running.
PRECONDITION. Your new controller should be located in this package, otherwise it won't work.

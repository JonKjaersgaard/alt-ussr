<body>
<p>Supports the builder with interactive assignment of controllers to modules selected in 
the simulation environment. Look in class called "AssignControllerTool.java".</p>
<hr />
<h1>HOW TO ...?</h1> 
<h2>Add my own controller class?</h2>
<ol> 
<li> Create new class and inherit it from "ControllerStrategy.java".</li>
<li> Implement the method called "activate()", which is the main method of your controller.
   Look other classes like "ATRONWheelController.java" and so on for inspiration.</li>
</ol>
<p>
PRECONDITIONS.<br />
<ol>
<li>Your new controller should be located in this package, otherwise it won't work. </li>
<li>The name of the class defining controller should contain the name of modular robot it is implemented for.
For instance: for ATRON it is <code>ATRONRotateContinuousNegative.java</code </li>   
</ol>

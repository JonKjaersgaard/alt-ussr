This package is dedicated to XML generation and loading in relation to project called "Quick Prototyping of
Simulation Scenarios". Due to the fact, that XML is widely used to store and share information, the Design
pattern called Template Method is used to support future reuse of this package. Meaning that there are
a number of different methods available to generate XML to the file and load the information from it later on. 
Moreover several of them are already declared  and called explicitly according to Template Method design pattern.
Currently the class called SaveLoadXMLBuilderTemplate. java is defining concrete format for XML and data
about simulation for current project.
HOWTO.

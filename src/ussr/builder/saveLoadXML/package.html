<p>This package is dedicated to XML generation and loading. Due to the fact, that XML is widely used to store and share information, the Design
pattern called Template Method is used to support future reuse of this package. Meaning, that there are
a number of different methods available to generate XML to the file and load the information from it later on. 
Moreover, several of them are already declared  and called explicitly according to Template Method design pattern.
Currently, the class called SaveLoadXMLBuilderTemplate. java is defining concrete format for XML to be saved.
There are two types of xml files used in USSR. These are: 1)simulation and 2)robot. Examples of both can be found here:

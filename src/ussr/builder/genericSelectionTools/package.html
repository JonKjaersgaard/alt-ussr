Provides several generic selection tools, which can be primary used in static (paused) state of simulation.
These tools can also be used during dynamic (running) state of simulation, however then the bugs should be expected. 
Generic, means that each of these tools can be used on any type of modular robot module. Selection tools means
that primary input device is mouse, to be more precise the click of left side of the mouse. Tools were tested on 
ATRON, MTRAN and Odin modular robots.
HOWTO. Set one of the selection tools?
In order to set one of the tools do the following for example for RemoveModule selection tool.
 JMESimulation.setPicker(new RemoveModule());

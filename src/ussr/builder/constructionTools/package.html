This package contains the interfaces, enumerations and classes, the main responsibility of which is
definition of construction tools (interactive tools) for construction of modular robots morphology.
The approach is common for all supported modular robots, but implementation algorithms slightly 
differ.That is why TEMPLATE METHOD pattern is used. Moreover to indicate that in order
to support new modular robot, new implementation is needed. Meaning that the core implementation
of the template methods should not change, only the primitive operation should. There is also
involved Abstract Factory design pattern. The code was tested on ATRON, MTRAN, Odin and CKbot modular robots, 
 as a result they are supported.

<h1>1) How to...</h1> 
<h2>1.1) Support new modular robot?</h2>
Let's investigate this question in step by step fashion. We will use design class diagram beneath heavily.
<img src ="../../../../doc/developer/builderPackage/ussr_builder_constructionTools.jpg" title= "Design class diagram with focus on construction tools)"><br /><br />

<ol>
 <li>Create new class and inherit it from <code>ModularRobotConstructionTemplate.java</code> In the diagram above, it is higligted with purple color and number 1 in the rectangle. It is also named as <code>NewModularRobotCosntructionTemplate </code> </li>
 <li> Implement inherited abstract methods, like <code>updateModuleMap(float x, float y, float z),  
   moveModuleComponentAccording(int connectorNr,Module selectedModule, JMEModuleComponent movableModuleComponent,Quaternion rotationQuatComponent)</code><br />
   and so on. Use existing support of modular robots like inspiration. For example class called 
    <code>ATRONConstructionTemplate.java</code> </li>
 <li>At this point,the most important question is: How should I implement these methods? Lets us try to answer this question.<br />
    First,ask your self how many components your module(robot type) consists of. For instance: ATRON has two components (two hemispheres).<br />
    If your module consists of two components and they are positioned in symmetry, then you are lucky:), meaning that there is less work. Mtran has 3 components, here things become much more difficult.<br /><br />
    
    First method you should focus on is <code>updateModuleMap(float x, float y, float z)</code>, this where the "magic" :) is happening.
    This method is using <code>OFFSET</code>, which is distance between two components(in case of symmetry modules) and <code>ModuleMapEntryHelper[] moduleMap </code>, which is containing mapping
    of (connector number and rotation of selected module) to(rotation and position) of new module to place with respect to selected module. 
    Using these new module is positioned with respect to selected module. See figure beneath for end result.<br />

     </li>   
 <li>Create new class and inherit it from <code>CommonOperationsTemplate.java.</code></li>
 <li> Implement inherited abstract methods,like:
    <code>addDefaultModule(String type, VectorDescription modulePosition,	RotationDescription moduleRotation, List<Color> colorsComponents, ArrayList<Color> colorsConectors),
    createNewModule(Module selectedModule)</code> and so on. </li>
 <li> Scan classes: <code>CommonOperationsTemplate.java</code> and <code>ConstructionToolSpecification.java</code> for bugs
    or missing implementation.</li>
 <li> You new robot should be available for tools listed in <code>ussr.builder.enums.ConstructionTools.java</code> and <code>ussr.builder.enums.LabelingTools.java</code></li>

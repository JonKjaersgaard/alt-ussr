This package supports the labeling of entities. Currently supports labeling of modules and connectors.
It is following TEMPLATE method design pattern. There is also involved Factory pattern.
HOWTO. Support the labeling of new entities?
1) extend your new class from LabelEntity.java class and implement the method called "getCurrentEntity()";
2) add  support for your new entity in  method called "getLabeling(String entityToLabel)" in the class
"LabelingFactory.java";
3) Scan the class called "LabelingToolSpecification" for missing implementation, especially
 method called "callSpecificTool()". 
4)Add your new tool in enumeration called "LabelingTools.java" and check that it is conforming
with the method in point above (4).
5) Set you new tool for use.

HOWTO. Set my new tool?
For example  we have now:
JME_simulation.setPicker(new LabelingToolSpecification(JME_simulation,this.entityToLabel,currentLabeljTextField.getText(),LabelingTools.LABEL_MODULE));
Let say you new entity is "Sensor", then you will have:
JME_simulation.setPicker(new LabelingToolSpecification(JME_simulation,"Sensor",currentLabeljTextField.getText(),LabelingTools.LABEL_SENSOR));

A physics simulation implementation based on JME (JMonkeyEngine).
Implements the interfaces defined in the <tt>ussr.physics</tt>
package.  Provides a collection of actuators and sensors as well as
various utility classes.  The components for building robots are
defined in
the <tt>ussr.physics.jme.actuators</tt>, <tt>ussr.physics.jme.connectors</tt>,
and <tt>ussr.physics.jme.sensors</tt> packages, whereas concrete robots are
defined in the <tt>ussr.physics.jme.robots</tt> package.

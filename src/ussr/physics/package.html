An abstract model of a physics engine, serves as the interface between physics-engine
independent classes and the physics engine.  The classes {@link PhysicsSimulation} and
{@link PhysicsSimulationHelper}> describe the general capabilities of a physics
simulation.  The class {@link PhysicsParameters} defines the parameters that can be set to
control the physics behavior of the simulation.  The class {@link PhysicsFactory} controls
the physics-engine specific factories for creating modules in the simulation.

<body>
An abstract model of a physics engine, serves as the interface between physics-engine
independent classes and the physics engine.  The classes <tt>PhysicsSimulation</tt>
and <tt>PhysicsSimulationHelper</tt> describes the general capabilities of a physics
simulation.  The class <tt>PhysicsParameters</tt> defines the parameters that can be
set to control the physics behavior of the simulation.

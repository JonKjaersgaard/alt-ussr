Building blocks for constructing simulation scenarios.  Can describe module components
in terms of their basic geometries, connections between modules, and the setup of the
enclosing world.  The module geometries must be translated into physics engine specific
shapes by the corresponding module factory.

TODO: Remove references to JME data types (quaternions, matrices, etc.)

@see <tt>ussr.physics.PhysicsParameters</tt> for where to set simulation parameters

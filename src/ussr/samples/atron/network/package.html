ATRON network controller.

<pre>
30/1-08 The current setup is with a RemoteControl and wheel1 as a ATRON network controller. 

1. Run ATRONCarSimulationRemoteControl
2. Start simulation "p"
3. Run ATRONNetworkControllerMain with run parameters "name serverIp portNo" e.g. "wheel1 127.0.0.1 10001"
4. Run RemoteControl and "connect" (default settings: server 127.0.0.1 port 10000)
5. Use the remote control
*****

More ATRON network controllers can be added to the simulation in ATRONCarSimulationRemoteControl
e.g. wheel2:10002

Only support for network controllers for wheels 1-4 is implemented

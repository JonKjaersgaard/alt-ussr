Building blocks for constructing simulation scenarios.  Can describe module components
in terms of their basic geometries, connector configurations etc.  The simulation is
described in terms of connections between modules and the setup of the
enclosing world.  Note that the module geometries must be translated into physics engine specific
shapes by the corresponding module factory.

<p>The building blocks are organized into the following subpackages:
<ul>
<li>{@link ussr.description.geometry} Geometry shapes for describing entities in the simulation</li>
<li>{@link ussr.description.robot} Robot building blocks</li>
<li>{@link ussr.description.setup} Simulation world setup</li>
</ul>

<p>The physics parameters of the simulation are set using {@link ussr.physics.PhysicsParameters} whereas module factories are manipulated using {@link ussr.physics.PhysicsFactory}.

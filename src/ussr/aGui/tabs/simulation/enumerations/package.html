Contains enumerations heavily used in Simulation tab implementation. Moreover, each enumeration is
wrapped over lower logic enumerations used by USSR. This is done in order to separate GUI related 
code and underlying logic of USSR.<br />
 NOTE: If new instances of these data types will be supported in underlying logic of USSR, this
 is the place to add new implementation in order for them to be supported in GUI.

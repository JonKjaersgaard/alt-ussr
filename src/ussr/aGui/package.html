Contains GUI source code. For implementation was used MVC(Model-View-Controller) and Strategy patterns.<br />
User Guide:<br />
There are two modes of running GUI 1) Stand alone and 2) During simulation.<br />
For 1) Run MainFrameAllInOne.java located in the same package as this file <br />
    2) Run simulation for instance "builder.BuilderMultiRobotSimulation.java" and after a while press "O" on keyboard.<br /><br />

DCD of the source code look beneath <br /> 
TODO:<br />
1) (Done) When connector is not selected, then freezing (eliminate that) <br />
2) (Done)Run simulation(XML): a) from GUI(DONE for during simulation, standAlone(FORGET IT)) and b) from console(DONE-LOADER) <br />
3) (Done)Move rendering of physics, wire state and so on into menu Bar (DONE)<br />
4) (Done)David: Possibility to add new tabs by means of the code(programmer perspective)(DONE) and GUI(DONE)<br />
  (TODO) Here also add David's and Brian's tabs (TODO).<br /> 
5)(Done) Run: fast, real-time (DONE). <br />
6) (Done)Control Visibility of the tabs from GUI Menu bar (DONE, however there are some problems with that.)<br /> 
7) (TODO)Make everything unnecessary disabled in construction Tab(TODO)<br />
8) (TODO)Run GUI window: 1) stand alone(TODO, FORGET IT) and 2)during simulation(DONE)<br />
9) (TODO)Integrate builder into Main window (TODO) <br />
10)(TODO)Adapt GUI to the modular(builder) robot in simulation(GUI started during simulation)(DONE) <br />
11)(TODO) Ask Ulrik about an idea of adding "NEW" class where new implementation is expected in future(TODO)<br />
12)(TODO)Ask Ulrik about letter of reference, placing your website on server (TODO)<br />
13)(TODO)Don't forget to agdapt to selected module the tab called "Assign Behavior" (TODO)<br />
14)(TODO) For no Entrance elements set and reset the toolTip(TODO)<br />
15)(TODO) Think about adding one more view of MAIN gui (without tabs, only command line and toolbar for controlling simulation) (TODO)<br /><br />
16)(TODO) Think about draggable tabs(TODO)<br />
16)(TODO)Run usability tests in "hall" fashion(WORK IN PROGRESS)<br />
17)(TODO)Should I clean up "dead code" in Brians project and move some of his classes in new GUI packages? <br />
18)(TODO)Fix bug when Brian's work starts and run button in main menu pressed<br /><br />
19)(TODO)Implement main frame modes<br />
20)(TODO)Think about integrating controller values <br />
21)(TODO)Do not forget to deal with compatibility issues between Construction and Visualization tabs<br /><br />
22)(TODO)During simulation set physics picker.
23)(TODO)Think about one more tool in rotation tool bar able with each mouse click rotate module with different rotation<br />
24)(TODO) Add new module in the center of the view <br />
25)(TODO)Add functionality to move, delete and so on whole robot<br />
26)(TODO) Ask Ulrik about visualize Should it start when simulation running?<br />

<h1> 1) How to ...? </h1>
<h2> 1.1) Start MainFrame (main GUI window)? </h2>
A) During simulation.<br />
            <code>  JMESimulation simulation = (JMESimulation)this;<br />
				ArrayList<TabsInter> tabs =  new ArrayList<TabsInter>();//All tabs displayed in the main GUI <br />
				tabs.add(new ConstructionTab("1 Step: Construct Robot",simulation));//Build in tab <br />
				tabs.add(new AssignBehavioursTab("2 Step: Assign Behaviour",simulation));//Build in tab <br />
				tabs.add(new NewTab("YOUR NEW TAB",simulation));//YOUR NEW TAB <br />
				tabs.add(new NewTab("YOUR NEW TAB1",simulation));//YOUR NEW TAB1 <br />	
				MainFrameInter mainFrame = new MainFrame(this,tabs); <br />			
				mainFrame.activateDuringSimulation(); </ code><br /> <br />
				The same code can be located in package "ussr.physics.jme", class "JMEBasicGraphicalSimulation.java", lines of code(LOCs) around (310 - 400)<br /><br /> 
B) Stand alone <br />
   Run MainFrame.java <br />
   
<h2> 1.2) Design my own tab ? </h2>
Look the DCD beneath (you new tab class is highlighted with purple colour) <br />
A) During simulation <br />
1)Locate the package "ussr.aGui.tabs" and class "NewTab"<br />
2) Copy  and paste the class,rename it for your convenience (in the same package) <br />
3)Implement the method called "initComponents()". For inspiration look class "ConstructionTab.java"<br />
4) Do not forget to instantiate and add you NEW tab in the class called "JMEBasicGraphicalSimulation.java",package "ussr.physics.jme", LOCs around (310 - 400)<br />
Look how it is done in previous section.<br /> <br />

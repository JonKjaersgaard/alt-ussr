Contains GUI source code. For implementation was used MVC(Model-View-Controller) and Strategy patterns.<br />
User Guide:<br />
There are two modes of running GUI 1) Stand alone and 2) During simulation.<br />
For 1) Run MainFrameAllInOne.java located in the same package as this file <br />
    2) Run simulation for instance "builder.BuilderMultiRobotSimulation.java" and after a while press "O" on keyboard.<br /><br />

DCD of the source code look beneath <br /> 
TODO:<br />
1) (Done) When connector is not selected, then freezing (eliminate that) <br />
2) (Done)Run simulation(XML): a) from GUI(DONE for during simulation, standAlone(FORGET IT)) and b) from console(DONE-LOADER) <br />
3) (Done)Move rendering of physics, wire state and so on into menu Bar (DONE)<br />
4) (Done)David: Possibility to add new tabs by means of the code(programmer perspective)(DONE) and GUI(DONE)<br />
  (TODO) Here also add David's and Brian's tabs (TODO).<br />

7) (TODO)Make everything unnecessary disabled in construction Tab<br />
8) (Done)Run GUI window: 1) stand alone(Done, FORGET IT) and 2)during simulation(DONE)<br />
9) (TODO)Integrate builder into Main window (TODO) <br />
10)(TODO)Adapt GUI to the modular(builder) robot in simulation(GUI started during simulation)(DONE) <br />
11)(TODO) Better have and example.Ask Ulrik about an idea of adding "NEW" class where new implementation is expected in future(TODO)<br />
12)(TODO)Ask Ulrik about letter of reference,Java certification, placing your website on server (TODO)<br />
13)(TODO)Don't forget to adapt to selected module the tab called "Assign Behavior" (TODO)<br />
14)(TODO) For no Entrance elements set and reset the toolTip(TODO)<br />
15)(FORGET IT) Think about adding one more view of MAIN gui (without tabs, only command line and toolbar for controlling simulation) (TODO)<br /><br />
16)(TODO) Think about draggable tabs(TODO)<br />
16)(WORK IN PROGRESS)Run usability tests in "hall" fashion<br />
17)(TODO)YES,Should I clean up "dead code" in Brians project and move some of his classes in new GUI packages? <br />
Format of package, package filter.
18)(TODO)Fix bug when Brian's work starts and run button in main menu pressed<br />
19)(TODO)Implement main frame modes<br />
20)(TODO)Think about integrating controller values <br />
21)(TODO)Do not forget to deal with compatibility issues between Construction and Visualization tabs<br /><br />
22)(Done)During simulation set physics picker.
23)(TODO)Think about one more tool in rotation tool bar able with each mouse click rotate module with different rotation<br />
24)(TODO) Add new module in the center of the view <br />
25)(TODO)Add functionality to move, delete and so on whole robot<br />
26)(TODO) (MOVE IT UP)Ask Ulrik about visualizer. Should it start when simulation running?<br />
27)(TODO)ASK ulrik if it would be good idea to add possibility for constructing new modular robot? (Like restart)<br />
28)(TODO)Andreas wants to implement controllers in DSL(script). For example select module and then write in GUI  "motorsRun(1)" <br />
30)(USED)Ask Ulrik about an idea to integrate enumerations into interfaces
31)Usability test with Andreas (Construct robot tab):<br />
          a)(Done) Somehow inidicate which button is active <br />
          b)(Done)increase the size of coboBoxes, because MAC shrinks them down <br />
          c)(Done)We definetely need Display for hints <br />
          d) Confusing is the fact that Picker is not working with the first selection of the mouse <br />
          e)(Done, Display for hints)Also confusing that you should select button and then select entities in simulation <br /> 
32) (TODO) Find out why file chooser has problems on MAC or maybe USSR and MAC.<br />
33) Usability test with Danny(Construct robot tab): <br /> 
          a)(Done)We definetely need Display for hints <br />
          b) (Done, Display for hints).How to control moving around in simulation environment? <br />
34)(TODO)Think about the tool for rotating modules when they are already in the morphology (so called "connector matcher")<br />
35)(TODO) Fix the bug with "loop" constrcution tool. Here the module is added onto another module. <br />
36)(Done) Construct Robot Tab. Remove robot when Start new robot selected. <br />
37)(TODO) Construct Robot Tab. Enable selection tool  when robot is loaded from XML <br /> 
37)(TODO) (KEEP IT)Decide what todo with Odin and default construction tool <br />
38)(TODO) cONTROLLER IN SIMULATION AND MORPHOLOGY XML FILES  <br />

<h1> 1) How to ...? </h1>
<h2> 1.1) Start MainFrame (main GUI window)? </h2>
A) During simulation.<br />
            <code>  JMESimulation simulation = (JMESimulation)this;<br />
				ArrayList<TabsInter> tabs =  new ArrayList<TabsInter>();//All tabs displayed in the main GUI <br />
				tabs.add(new ConstructionTab("1 Step: Construct Robot",simulation));//Build in tab <br />
				tabs.add(new AssignBehavioursTab("2 Step: Assign Behaviour",simulation));//Build in tab <br />
				tabs.add(new NewTab("YOUR NEW TAB",simulation));//YOUR NEW TAB <br />
				tabs.add(new NewTab("YOUR NEW TAB1",simulation));//YOUR NEW TAB1 <br />	
				MainFrameInter mainFrame = new MainFrame(this,tabs); <br />			
				mainFrame.activateDuringSimulation(); </ code><br /> <br />
				The same code can be located in package "ussr.physics.jme", class "JMEBasicGraphicalSimulation.java", lines of code(LOCs) around (310 - 400)<br /><br /> 
B) Stand alone <br />
   Run MainFrame.java <br />
   
<h2> 1.2) Design my own tab ? </h2>
Look the DCD beneath (you new tab class is highlighted with purple colour) <br />
A) During simulation <br />
1)Locate the package "ussr.aGui.tabs" and class "NewTab"<br />
2) Copy  and paste the class,rename it for your convenience (in the same package) <br />
3)Implement the method called "initComponents()". For inspiration look class "ConstructionTab.java"<br />
4) Do not forget to instantiate and add you NEW tab in the class called "JMEBasicGraphicalSimulation.java",package "ussr.physics.jme", LOCs around (310 - 400)<br />
Look how it is done in previous section.<br /> <br />

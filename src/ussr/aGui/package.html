<p>Contains GUI source code. For implementation were used MVC (Model View Controller) and Strategy patterns.</p>
<p>Brief User Guide:<br />
<ol>
<li>Run MainFrameSeparate.java</li>
<li> There are two following options:<br /> 
     a) Press <img src ="../../../resources/mainFrame/icons/png/newSimulation.png" title= "new Simulation"> to start new simulation. <br />
     b) Open xml file describing simulation, by selecting "Open" <img src ="../../../resources/mainFrame/icons/png/open.png" title= "Open"> icon in main GUI window.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1> 1) How to ...? </h1>
<h2> 1.1) Design (Develop) my own main GUI window? </h2>
<p>Implement your own class highlighted with purple color in the design class diagram beneath. The same example in the form of source code
can be found in the current package. </p>

<h2> 1.2) Change the tool tips and texts on components of main gui window?</h2>
<p>  Locate the text or tooltip and refactor it here: 
<a href="enumerations/MainFrameComponentsText.java"> ussr.aGui.enumerations.MainFrameComponentsText.java </a>
</p>
<h2> 1.3) Implement my own JOptionPane ? </h2>
<p> Use and expand if needed, implementation located here: <a href="enumerations/JOptionPaneMessages.java"> ussr.aGui.enumerations.JOptionPaneMessages.java </a></p>

<h2> 1.4) Support new icons used in MainFrame, but not in tabs? </h2>
<p> Expand implementation in following place: <a href="enumerations/MainFrameIcons.java"> ussr.aGui.enumerations.MainFrameIcons.java </a></p>

<h2> 1.5) Design (Develop) my own tab ? </h2>
<p> All tabs are instantiated in interface called MainFramesInter, look DCD above.
This is where you will have to instantiate your own. There is also example commented with keyword
"YOUR NEW TAB" directly in the code, indicating the places to add your source code. Go to package 
<a href="tabs/package.html"> "ussr.aGui.tabs"->package.html</a>
to find out how to implement your tab in more detail.</p>

<h2> 1.6) Support new or reuse existing FileChooser?</h2>
<p> Reuse functionality described here: <a href="fileChoosing/package.html"> "ussr.aGui.tabs"->package.html</a> </p>

<h2> 1.7) Find more information about Interactive construction of modular robot morphology and assignment of behaviors?</h2>
<p> Look here: <a href="../../../doc/developer/MasterThesis.pdf"> MasterThesis.pdf</a>, start from page 75 if you are interested in implementation. At the same time, remember that this
document was written before current GUI was implemented. As a result, all GUI related description should be disregarded, some of business logic(Model) as well.  
You are most likely to find  a lot of inconsistencies.</p>

<h2> 1.8) Find out even more about packages from "ussr.aGui" to "ussr.builder" and partially "ussr.remote.facade" </h2>
<p> Write an e-mail to Konstantinas Kuznecovas:  <a href="mailto:kuznetsovas2003@yahoo.com?subject=YourWebsite">kuznetsovas2003@yahoo.com </a>.
Please, do not expect an answer at once, you will most likely receive it during several days. This is assuming I know it:). </p>

Contains GUI source code. For implementation was used MVC(Model-View-Controller) and Strategy patterns.<br />
User Guide:<br />
Run MainFrame.java class(Not yet) or start any simulation and press "O" on keyboard.<br /><br />
DCD of the source code look beneath <br /> 
TODO:<br />
1) When connector is not selected, then freezing (eliminate that)(DONE) <br />
2) Run simulation(XML): a) from GUI(DONE for during simulation, standAlone(TODO)) and b) from console(DONE-LOADER) <br />
3) Move rendering of physics, wire state and so on into menu Bar (DONE)<br />
4) David: Possibility to add new tabs by means of the code(programmer perspective)(DONE) and GUI(DONE)<br />
   Here also add David's and Brian's tabs (TODO).<br /> 
5) Run: fast, real-time (DONE). <br />
6) Control Visibility of the tabs from GUI Menu bar (DONE, however there are some problems with that.)<br /> 
7) Make everything unnecessary disabled in construction Tab(TODO)<br />
8) Run GUI window: 1) stand alone(DONE, however should integrate USSR logic) and 2)during simulation(DONE)<br />
9) Integrate builder into Main window (TODO) <br />
10) Adapt GUI to the modular robot in simulation(GUI started during simulation)(DONE) <br />
11) Ask Ulrik about an idea of adding "NEW" class where new implementation is expected in future(TODO)<br />
12) Ask Ulrik about letter of reference, placing your website on server (TODO)<br />
13) Don't forget to agdapt to selected module the tab called "Assign Behavior" (TODO)<br />
14) For no Entrance elements set and reset the toolTip(TODO)<br />
15) Think about adding one more view of MAIN gui (without tabs, only command line and toolbar for controlling simulation) (TODO)<br /><br />
16) Think about draggable tabs(TODO)<br />
16) Run usability tests in "hall" fashion(WORK IN PROGRESS)<br />
17) Should I clean up "dead code" in Brians project and move some of his classes in new GUI packages? <br />
18) Fix bug when Brian's work starts and run button in main menu pressed<br /><br />
19) Implement main frame modes<br />
20) Think about integrating controller values <br />
21) Do not forget to deal with compatibility issues between Construction and Visualization tabs<br /><br />

<h1> 1) How to ...? </h1>
<h2> 1.1) Start MainFrame (main GUI window)? </h2>
A) During simulation.<br />
            <code>  JMESimulation simulation = (JMESimulation)this;<br />
				ArrayList<TabsInter> tabs =  new ArrayList<TabsInter>();//All tabs displayed in the main GUI <br />
				tabs.add(new ConstructionTab("1 Step: Construct Robot",simulation));//Build in tab <br />
				tabs.add(new AssignBehavioursTab("2 Step: Assign Behaviour",simulation));//Build in tab <br />
				tabs.add(new NewTab("YOUR NEW TAB",simulation));//YOUR NEW TAB <br />
				tabs.add(new NewTab("YOUR NEW TAB1",simulation));//YOUR NEW TAB1 <br />	
				MainFrameInter mainFrame = new MainFrame(this,tabs); <br />			
				mainFrame.activateDuringSimulation(); </ code><br /> <br />
				The same code can be located in package "ussr.physics.jme", class "JMEBasicGraphicalSimulation.java", lines of code(LOCs) around (310 - 400)<br /><br /> 
B) Stand alone <br />
   Run MainFrame.java <br />
   
<h2> 1.2) Design my own tab ? </h2>
Look the DCD beneath (you new tab class is highlighted with purple colour) <br />
A) During simulation <br />
1)Locate the package "ussr.aGui.tabs" and class "NewTab"<br />
2) Copy  and paste the class,rename it for your convenience (in the same package) <br />
3)Implement the method called "initComponents()". For inspiration look class "ConstructionTab.java"<br />
4) Do not forget to instantiate and add you NEW tab in the class called "JMEBasicGraphicalSimulation.java",package "ussr.physics.jme", LOCs around (310 - 400)<br />
Look how it is done in previous section.<br /> <br />

<p>Contains GUI source code. For implementation were used MVC (Model View Controller) and Strategy patterns.</p>
<p>Brief User Guide:<br />
<ol>
<li>Run MainFrameSeparate.java</li>
<li>Open xml file describing simulation, by selecting "Open" <img src ="../../../resources/mainFrame/icons/jpg/open.jpg" title= "Open"> icon in main GUI window</li>
</ol>
</p>
<hr />

<h1> 1) How to ...? </h1>
<h2> 1.1) Design (Develop) my own main GUI window? </h2>
<p>Implement your own class highlighted with purple color in the design class diagram beneath. The same example in the form of source code
can be found in the current package. </p>
<img src ="../../../doc/developer/guiPackage/focusOnMainGuiWindow.jpg" title= "Design class diagram with focus on MainFrame(main GUI window)">
<br/>
<br/>
<hr />

<h2> 1.2) Design (Develop) my own tab ? </h2>
<p> All tabs are instantiated in interface called MainFramesInter, look DCD above.
That is where you will have to instantiate your own. There is also example commented with keyword
"YOUR NEW TAB" directly in the code, indicating the places to add your source code. Go to package "ussr.aGui.tabs"->package.html
to find out how to implement your tab in more detail.</p>

<hr />

<h2> 1.3) Change the tool tips and texts on components of main gui window?</h2>
<p>  Locate the text or tooltip and refactor it here: <code> ussr.aGui.enumerations.MainFrameComponentsText.java </code> </p>


<h1> QUESTIONS TO ASK ULRIK</h1>
<ol>
<li> (+)What do you think about repositioning and resizing of simulation window?</li>
<li> (+)Restart button?</li>
<li> (+)Improve loop tool?</li>
<li> (?)Special start up frame, like Eclipse has for switching workspaces. But in our case this will be to 
choose XML file?</li>'
<li> (+) Move labeling functionality to new tab for assignment of controllers</li>
<li> (+) Display hint deactivate, introduce "Expert" choice in GUI</li>
<li> (?) Consider adding image of the tool on mouse tip</li>
</ol>









DCD of the source code look beneath <br /> 
TODO:<br />
1) (Done) When connector is not selected, then freezing (eliminate that) <br />
2) (Done)Run simulation(XML): a) from GUI(DONE for during simulation, standAlone(FORGET IT)) and b) from console(DONE-LOADER) <br />
3) (Done)Move rendering of physics, wire state and so on into menu Bar (DONE)<br />
4) (Done)David: Possibility to add new tabs by means of the code(programmer perspective)(DONE) and GUI(DONE)<br />
  (TODO) Here also add David's and Brian's tabs (TODO).<br /> 
5)(Done) Run: fast, real-time (DONE). <br />
6) (Done)Control Visibility of the tabs from GUI Menu bar (DONE, however there are some problems with that.)<br /> 
7) (TODO)Make everything unnecessary disabled in construction Tab<br />
8) (Done)Run GUI window: 1) stand alone(Done, FORGET IT) and 2)during simulation(DONE)<br />
9) (TODO)Integrate builder into Main window (TODO) <br />
10)(TODO)Adapt GUI to the modular(builder) robot in simulation(GUI started during simulation)(DONE) <br />
11)(TODO) Better have and example.Ask Ulrik about an idea of adding "NEW" class where new implementation is expected in future(TODO)<br />
12)(TODO)Ask Ulrik about letter of reference,Java certification, placing your website on server (TODO)<br />
13)(TODO)Don't forget to adapt to selected module the tab called "Assign Behavior" (TODO)<br />
14)(TODO) For no Entrance elements set and reset the toolTip(TODO)<br />
15)(FORGET IT) Think about adding one more view of MAIN gui (without tabs, only command line and toolbar for controlling simulation) (TODO)<br /><br />
16)(TODO) Think about draggable tabs(TODO)<br />
16)(WORK IN PROGRESS)Run usability tests in "hall" fashion<br />
17)(TODO)YES,Should I clean up "dead code" in Brians project and move some of his classes in new GUI packages? <br />
Format of package, package filter.
18)(TODO)Fix bug when Brian's work starts and run button in main menu pressed<br />
19)(TODO)Implement main frame modes<br />
20)(TODO)Think about integrating controller values <br />
21)(TODO)Do not forget to deal with compatibility issues between Construction and Visualization tabs<br /><br />
22)(Done)During simulation set physics picker.
23)(TODO)Think about one more tool in rotation tool bar able with each mouse click rotate module with different rotation<br />
24)(TODO) Add new module in the center of the view <br />
25)(TODO)Add functionality to move, delete and so on whole robot<br />
26)(TODO) (MOVE IT UP)Ask Ulrik about visualizer. Should it start when simulation running?<br />
27)(TODO)ASK ulrik if it would be good idea to add possibility for constructing new modular robot? (Like restart)<br />
28)(TODO)Andreas wants to implement controllers in DSL(script). For example select module and then write in GUI  "motorsRun(1)" <br />
30)(USED)Ask Ulrik about an idea to integrate enumerations into interfaces
31)Usability test with Andreas (Construct robot tab):<br />
          a)(Done) Somehow inidicate which button is active <br />
          b)(Done)increase the size of coboBoxes, because MAC shrinks them down <br />
          c)(Done)We definetely need Display for hints <br />
          d) Confusing is the fact that Picker is not working with the first selection of the mouse <br />
          e)(Done, Display for hints)Also confusing that you should select button and then select entities in simulation <br /> 
32) (TODO) Find out why file chooser has problems on MAC or maybe USSR and MAC.<br />
33) Usability test with Danny(Construct robot tab): <br /> 
          a)(Done)We definetely need Display for hints <br />
          b) (Done, Display for hints).How to control moving around in simulation environment? <br />
34)(TODO)Think about the tool for rotating modules when they are already in the morphology (so called "connector matcher")<br />
35)(TODO) Fix the bug with "loop" constrcution tool. Here the module is added onto another module. <br />
36)(Done) Construct Robot Tab. Remove robot when Start new robot selected. <br />
37)(TODO) Construct Robot Tab. Enable selection tool  when robot is loaded from XML <br /> 
37)(TODO) (KEEP IT)Decide what todo with Odin and default construction tool <br />
38)(TODO) cONTROLLER IN SIMULATION AND MORPHOLOGY XML FILES  <br />

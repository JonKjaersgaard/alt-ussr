<p>Supports file choosing with two slightly differing forms of implementation and ther are: 
1)JFileChooser from Swing and 2) FileDialog from AWT libraries. 
The reason why there are two implementations is that JFileChooser is well supported for Windows and Linux OSs(Operating System), 
however there are problems with (look and feel) and file filtering on Macintosh (Mac). 
It seems that FileDialog do not have these problems on Mac. The disadvantage is "double coding". 
FUTURE SOLUTIONS: It is possible to implement custom look and feel (too time consuming at this moment) and 
second is to wait until JFileChooser will be better supported on Mac.</p>

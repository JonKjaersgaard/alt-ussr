Model description       : The Paladin is Jasonac Vaughn. Since the death of his thief parents,
				 has traveled the world searching to erradicate the goblin
				 hordes that suffocate his homeworld. After years of tracking
				 the source of the goblin invasions, Vaughn came to a final
				 battle with the Darklord, a formerly human general whos soul
				 and body had been corrupted by goblin gods. Following the
				 Darklord's defeat, Vaughn set out to scatter the general's
				 magical armour throughout the land. One day he stumbled upon
				 a portal in an underground cave, and was transported to
				 another dimension: the Arena.


Other info              : This is a model of my first D&D character that I had used when I
				first starting playing D&D.The model is higher poly than
				normal q3 models, but since i'm planning on
				using it for a portfolio piece, and converting it to
				UT2003...ah, heck, look, i'm a poly junky.

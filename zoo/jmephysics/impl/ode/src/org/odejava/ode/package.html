<p>
    Low level 1:1 binding of the C ODE library. This can be used directly
    to use ODE in Java when ODE method calls are desired.
</p>

<p>
    The high level Odejava API which uses this binding is recommended for normal use.
    <b>Warning:</b> While it is possible to mix and match the low and high level API's,
    this is <i>not</i> recommended as it may lead to unexpected results. This is especially
    important if an object is created in the high level API, it should not be
    altered with the low level API as subsiquent calls to the high level API may be inconsistent.

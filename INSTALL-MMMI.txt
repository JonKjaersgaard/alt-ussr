Internal MMMI instructions for getting USSR up an running from the SVN server
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For general documentation see README.html

Note: this document assumes that Eclipse is being used to check out and compile USSR.
USSR should run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

(1) Install eclipse (eclipse.org) and JDK 1.5 or higher (use JDK 1.5 compliance
    before doing a commit). For MAC OS: strict 1.5 (1.6 won't work due to libodejava.jnilib)

(2) Install the SVN plugin (subclipse.tigris.org): see the SVN site for instructions

(3) Import the project directly from SVN:
    Choose "Window -> Open Perspective -> Other...", pick "SVN Repository Exploring"
    Click the tiny "SVN+" button top right of the "SVN Repository" window
    Enter the appropriate URL (https://svn.mip.sdu.dk/ussr)
    Type SVN username and password when appropriate, click "Accept permanently" for the certificate
    (The ussr repository should now be visisble in the "SVN Repository" window)
    Left-click once on the small triangle to see the "ussr" directory inside the repository
    Right-click on the ussr directory that appeared, pick "Checkout..."
    Pick "Check out as project in the workspace" and click "Finish"
    (Wait for a long time)

(4) USSR should now be installed on your machine.
    Note that there may be compilation errors in the source directories starting with "home"
    as these are being used for experiments and are now always in a stable state.
    To try a basic simulation, open the directory "src" (topmost folder), navigate to the
    package "ussr.samples.atron", right-click on the class "ATRONCarSimulation", and choose
    "Run As -> Java Application" (ignore the dialog box about errors in the project if it pops
    up, so long as the errors come from the "home" source folders).  Once the graphical window
    showing the simulation pops up, press "P" to unpause the simulation and see the ATRON car
    drive towards the box obstacles.

(5) If USSR does not work. 
	USSR should work directly when checked out. If not make sure that all *.jar in sub-directories 
	of the "zoo" directory is included in the project's build path, except for "swt.jar" which causes strange 
	GUI problems on MACs. For "lwjgl.jar" set the native library location to "ussr/zoo/jME_2.0/lib/natives"
	(meaning that you right-click on zoo/jME_physics/src, 'Properties', and set the native library location path)
	Also add the source folders: "zoo/jME_physics/src", "zoo/jME_physics/impl/ode/src" and "zoo/jME_physics/impl/jbullet/src". 
	If USSR complies but crashes during startup try deleting "properties.cfg" in the "ussr" folder.

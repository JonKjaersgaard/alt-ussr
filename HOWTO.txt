HOWTO: basic introduction to working with the simulator 

Javadoc documentation is available in the doc subdirectory.

(1) Running a simulation

Run a simulation main class such as ussr.samples.atron.ATRONCarSimulation

- To pause/unpause the simulation, use 'P'
- To move around in the simulation, hold down the right mouse button while using
  A/S/D/W as arrow keys.  Use the mouse wheel to move up/down.

(2) Adding a new simulation

Use an existing template as an example; a simulation must specify what robot to
use (including the controller), module positions, and can use changeWorldHook
like in ATRONCarSimulation to e.g. add obstacles.

(3) Adding a new robot

To add a new robot type, create an appropriate package to contain the robot 
description (example: see ussr.samples.atron.ATRON).  The robot description can
use elements from the package ussr.robotbuildingclocks.  Concretely,
the physics-engine-independent configuration of a robot is done using the classes
in ussr.robotbuildingblocks: the building blocks are interpreted by a module factory
to create physically simulated modules.  If the user of the robot does not need to
be able to do any configuration, the description geometry can simple be e.g. a sphere
or some dummy geometry.  The type name in the robot description is used to identify
what module factory to use to instantiate the robot for the specific physics engine. 

The physics engine representation of a module (the central element) is implemented 
as a module factory in the package ussr.physics.jme.robots.  The module factory
uses components defined in the package ussr.physics.jme to build a module.

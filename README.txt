Unified Simulator for Self-reconfigurable [modular] Robots (USSR)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Unified Simulator for Self-reconfigurable Robots (USSR).  
The user manual available in the "manual" subdirectory provides general
information on installing and using USSR.  Javadoc information is available
in the "doc" subdirectory.

Note that information for how to install directly from the MMMI SVN repository
is available in the file "INSTALL-MMMI.txt"

In more detail, for getting started with USSR using eclipse, please see 
manual/install.html.  We recommend that you use eclipse for working with USSR, 
nevertheless, in case you are not using eclipse, we have included the compiled 
class files in the ussr/bin directory, so the biggest hassle is setting up the 
library paths, which is described (for eclipse) in the install.html file.  For 
a quick overview of how to add new simulations and robots to the simulator, see 
manual/howto.html

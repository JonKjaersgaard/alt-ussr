Unified Simulator for Self-reconfigurable [modular] Robots (USSR)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Unified Simulator for Self-reconfigurable Robots (USSR).  For
getting started with USSR using eclipse, please see INSTALL.pdf.  We recommend
that you use eclipse for working with USSR, nevertheless, in case you are
not using eclipse, we have included the compiled class files in the ussr/bin
directory, so the biggest hassle is setting up the library paths, which is 
described (for eclipse) in the INSTALL.pdf file.  For a quick overview of 
how to add new simulations and robots to the simulator, see HOWTO.txt
